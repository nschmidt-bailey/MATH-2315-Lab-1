# Global CO2 Emissions, In Depth from 1971-2020 
Analysis will be done on emission metrics for several countries, the major focus will be on the emissions of the top ten emitters during a time period of 1971-2020.
### Description, methods, and conclusions:
This lab focuses on the CO2 emissions of international nations and the patterns they produce during certain time periods. Problems during this lab included removing non countries from the data, such as Asia or the world, and determining the proper methods to use for certain data outputs. Methods include the use of histograms, boxlopts, timeplots, and many analysis techniques, like the info or head command, to narrow the scope of the data. After going through the different data interpretations, the main conclusions include that emission levels have greatly increased in the last 50 years. Countries like China, The United States, and India lead the globe in emissions. As more data is added yearly for countries across the globe, it also becomes noticable that average international emission levels have and may continue to increase.
### Requirements for Completion:
In order to complete this data analysis, pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, and missingno were all downloaded. These softwares allow for data analysis and plot creation that would not be as seamless in usual Python.
### Data Used:
The file used for data in this assignment is provided by Our World in Data.(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owid/co2-data/master/owid-co2-data.csv). 
### Data Processing and Cleanup:
Several strategies and forms of code were used to clean the data in this lab. For example, in the time plots, the x and y axis were minimized to best frame the data. Along with this, using functions like isin allowed for filtered datasets to be created from the raw dataset. By creating those datasets, like df_select, df_topten, and df_toptenyear, certain subsections were able to be plotted and analyzed much more easily and less bulky code was created.
