# Global CO2 Emissions, In Depth: 1971-2020 
## The file used for data in this assignment is provided by Our World in Data.
(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owid/co2-data/master/owid-co2-data.csv). Analysis will be done on emission metrics for several countries, the major focus will be on the emissions of the top ten emitters during a time period of 1971-2020.
### A Description section that includes a brief description of the project. This section should briefly describe the problem, methods, and general conclusions of the project. 
This lab focuses on the CO2 emissions of international countries and the patterns they produce during certain time periods. Problems during this lab included removing non countries from the data, such as Asia or the world, and determining the proper methods to use for certain data outputs. Methods include the use of histograms, boxlopts, timeplots, and many analysis techniques to narrow the scope of the data. After going through the different data interpretations, the main conclusions include
### A Requirements section that describes the software used in the project.
In order to complete this data analysis, pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, missingno were all downloaded. These softwares allow for data analysis and plot creation that would not be as seamless in usual Python.
### A Data section that describes the source of the data, with links.
The file used for data in this assignment is provided by Our World in Data.(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owid/co2-data/master/owid-co2-data.csv). 
### A Data Processing section that briefly describes the major steps taken to clean the data. This section should refer to the Colab notebook that does the data processing and to the resulting clean csv file.
Several strategies and forms of code were used to clean data. For example, in
